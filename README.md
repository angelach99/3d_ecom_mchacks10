#  🚀 OnTheGo 
  - A Hackathon Project (McHacks) designed and deployed within 24 Hours.
  
  - See our [post](https://devpost.com/software/stujiji) for more detail about the project.

#  🌟 Inspiration

Have you ever felt burned out when you need to relocate or move, wondering how to deal with all the furniture and home supplies that are hard to bring? We are inspired to create an intelligent platform where students can resell or purchase home supplies among each other. What’s cooler is that we used Echo3d API so users can upload or view 3D products! The ultimate goal is to form a welcoming student community and ease the problem of taking care of home supplies when relocating.

#  🎉 What it does

The platform will first show its home page where we outline the purpose, then a login page will follow as we want to keep track of the user information and product they sell or buy. Next, we have the option where users can upload images or 3D models, and descriptions for the items that they would like to sell. And ultimately on the product page, we implemented a recommendation system that will provide similar products to the users.

#  ⚙️ How we built it

##  Front-end: React.js
  We used utilized Figma the design, and then used Anima to convert the design to our React.js front-end codebase.

##  Back-end: Node.js
  Utilize Node.js as the backend development environment and MongoDB as the database to store user data.

#  🚧 Challenges we faced

While most of us are not familiar with React.js and Node.js, we managed to speed learn a lot of stuff in a tight time limit. Another challenge that we ran into is that we were not able to complete the whole scope as what we initially planned within 24 hours.

#  🏆 Accomplishments

We are proud that we were able to build an aesthetically pleasing front-end using a Figma template, and we had the chance to explore various APIs and evaluate how we can utilize them.

#  🧠 What we learned

While each of us has different specialties, we were able to bring different skills and ideas to the table and collaborate with each other. We learned how to build a website using React.js and Node.js, and on the other hand, we also developed teamwork skills and soft skills.

#  🚀 What's next for OnTheGo

As for future improvement, we can create a chatting space between buyers and sellers - It would be similar to the chat area in Kijiji, but here we support users to visualize their product in the 3D format.
